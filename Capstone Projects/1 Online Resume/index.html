    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a 24-year-old (born 8th May 1999) guy from Bulgaria, looking to live
      and work abroad while developing professionally and personally into a
      fantabulous person.
    </p>

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>
      I studied in PPMG "Akad. Ivan Tsenov" in Vratsa, Bulgaria with a focus on
      IT, Mathematics, and Physics (2010-2018). I graduated with an average of
      5.73 and had the lowest grade in music out of my peers (I'd like to
      believe I'm better musically nowadays).
    </p>
    <p>
      During my high school years, I went to a lot of extracurricular activities
      which allowed me to see what I was capable of compared to my peers from
      all over the country. All the competitions I went to gave me a lot of
      amazing memories as well as the opportunity to travel across the country
      and even abroad it, plus a free admission to our country's most
      prestigious university when I was graduating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite the aforementioned free admission, I wanted to try my luck abroad
      so I studied for an English Certificate and earned a C2 Cambridge level.
    </p>
    <p>
      I ended up going to the University of Applied Sciences - Saxion in
      Deventer, Netherlands, with a Software Engineering Bachelor (2019-2021). I
      aced my first year and got the "Getuigschrift propedeuse HBO First Year
      Certificate". I ended up stopping my studies after the end of my 3rd
      years' 1st semester around the whole COVID pandemic.
    </p>
