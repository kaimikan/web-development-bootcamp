All the project before17-note-keeper-react-app were not ran on a local environment but instead on codesandbox.
They have deprecated code that would need to be changed in order to run them.

I put them here for safekeeping and to have examples of key features on hand.

17-note-keeper-react-app is the product of all of them combined and it should actually run.
The others should be able to run in codesandbox without much problems and locally after some problem fixing.
