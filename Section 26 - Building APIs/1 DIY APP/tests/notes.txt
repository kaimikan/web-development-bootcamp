got some help with trying testing from mrvlicecode
here are some notes:

- testing done with mocha, chai and supertest dependencies

- notice export default app in the bottom of index.js -> that's how we get the endpoints in endpoints.test.js

- npm run test 'tests/**/example.test.js' -> replace example.test.js with any other test file name in the tests folder to run it
- npm run test --file tests/example.test.js -> also works ^

- chai documentation for commands reference: https://www.chaijs.com/api/bdd/
